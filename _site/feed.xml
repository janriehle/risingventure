        <title>Practical Application of a Multi-Vertical Strategy in e-Commerce</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Find below a link to an article about the implementation of a Multi-Vertical Strategy in e-Commerce written by me and published on the web-portal of Ecommerce Brasil in May 2017:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ecommercebrasil.com.br/artigos/multi-store-alternativa-programa-de-fidelizacao/&quot;&gt;Article on E-commerce Brasil (in Portuguese)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please find the English version of the Article below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Practical Application of a Multi-Vertical Strategy in e-Commerce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyer fidelization has proven to be a serious challenge for e-commerce companies all over the world. Clients tend not to be loyal to online-store brands and repeat their comparison- and selection-process for every new purchase.
Potential solutions like rewarding repeated-buying behaviour with customer-clubs and similar do provide help, but in most cases they are not sufficient to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative strategy is to build a multi-vertical strategy in online-retailing, in which basically “all roads lead to Rome” (meaning, all customer clicks lead to the same retailer’s online store verticals), without the customer necessarily being aware of the fact that he is buying from the same company independent of the site he acquires the product at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current crisis and resulting consolidation process e-commerce in Brazil is currently undergoing seems to provide an interesting foundation for the application of such an approach, either by simply buying competitive verticals and adding them to an existing portfolio, or by launching new verticals from scratch. Whereas the later approach can be very time-consuming and costly, the approach of diversifying channels through acquisitions is a trend that can be observed in various acquisitions within the Brazilian E-Commerce Marketplace in 2015 and  2016, and this trend is likely to continue in 2017 as the crisis still does allow for economic acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three examples of such recent consolidation activities which include application of the above strategy are:
Online retailing of optical products, with French Optics Holding Essilor acquiring eOtica.com.br, e-lens.com.br as well as lema21.com.br (through eOtica)
bebestore.com.br acquiring baby.com.br and both continuing operations as independent end-customer verticals;
Grupo Cantu acquiring itaro.com.br and pneusfacil.com.br, and operating them together with their existing vertical PneuStore.com.br&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is explaining a process for the implementation of such a multi-vertical strategy developed by the author in the positioning process for Pneustore/Grupo Cantu during the acquisition of Itaro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perspective a retailer should take when applying the multi-vertical strategy should be: “How do I make sure that whatever potential search my clients do they go they will end up buying the product in one of my stores?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to make sure that - instead of having your channels compete with each other - commercial conditions, communication and perceived value proposition complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the process of determining the optimal channel-positioning includes all of the following steps in the following order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Segment your existing Customer Base&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Normalize the data structure for the client-bases over all verticals to make sure you work with the same attributes per vertical
examples of common attributes are: age, income, geography, experience with product category, price sensitivity, frequency of online usage, etc.
If the existing data is not sufficient in one or more of the vertical’s CRM systems, actively enrich the data via customer surveys
Do a regression analyses over the global dataset to find similarities per vertical
Develop a subset of simplified customer models, representing at least 85% of the overall client base per vertical
= &amp;gt; The result defines your base for a generic customer type per vertical&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Map out a Customer Decision Tree&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Map a simplified generic customer decision tree for your sector. Create customized decision trees for each of the generic customer models identified above
An example for such a customer decision tree could include the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/decision_tree.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Map your Vertical’s Competitive Environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Map your own and your competitor’s verticals against each other, use the attributes you qualified for your generic customer profiles
Connect the Decision Tree and the Competitive Environment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Verify connections between your competitor’s verticals and your generic customer profiles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Use this step to return to step 1 and add customer profiles which your verticals might not serve yet. Repeat this until you have developed a deeper understanding of the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Configure your Verticals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a complete picture of the competitive environment, re-configure step by step your vertical’s attributes in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercial Attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assortment Strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brand and Communicational Aspects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Verification of Results and if Iteration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Update the competitive Environment Map based on your new Vertical Configuration
Verify the Customer Decision Tree: Is the maximum number of clients being directed to your stores? Is there more optimization potential to gain additional market share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No =&amp;gt; You are done!&lt;br /&gt;
Yes =&amp;gt; Redo steps 2 to 5 in order to maximize your potential&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incomplete process, or an approach in which the above steps are been taken in the wrong order, but also a lack of necessary iteration of the process is likely lead to a suboptimal positioning of the different ecommerce verticals, and thus result in those vertical competing with each other instead of complementing each other to dominate the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After implementation, it is advisable to go through the entire process in a defined period, for example all three months in order to a) include learnings and b) adopt to a constantly changing competitive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Search Fund Asset Class in Brazil</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of a Search Fund is relatively new in the Brazilian Market. Apart from Rising Venture we could identify another five Search Funds operating in the country, all of them are either in the search or in the deal phase.  Find an overview of four funds we could gather some information about below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Fund&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Start-Date&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Stage&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Team&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;


  &lt;tr class=&quot;even&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Taqia Capital&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Traditional&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;January 2015&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Deal-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Maissa Capital&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Traditional&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;August 2015&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Search-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Colibri Investimentos&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Traditional&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;March 2016&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Deal-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Sektra Capital&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Self-Funded&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;January 2016&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Search-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;220 Capital&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Traditional&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;November 2016&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Search-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Two&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Risign Venture&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Self-Funded but fundraising&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;April 2016&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Fundraising &amp;amp; Search-Phase&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To our knowledge there have also been Search Funds during the 90’s as well as in the early 2000’s, some of them also with successful acquisitions and exits. However, most of these funds did not follow the “traditional” Search Fund model but were rather self-funded or funded by a single investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the asset-class is not very common in Brazil, the existing traditional Search Funds listed above are all mainly backed by US investors.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Search Fund Performance Comparison</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before deciding on starting a Search-Fund we have done some basic comparison of asset class performance mainly for our own purposes and we would like to share the results here. The data is publicly available and just needs to be pulled together as we did it in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to remark that the comparison needs to be handled with care for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average returns for all the examined asset classes varies over time. We try to reflect an average over the last 10 to 15 years&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of sources for this kind of data, and they are not all necessarily equal; so we needed to average over several of them - however this approach seems fair to us since there were no outliers with &amp;gt; 10% variation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;IRR is a relative metric as it does not provide any information on the timing of the cash-flows. This means the metric assumes that payouts during the investment cycle could be immediately re-allocated into assets that perform with the same rate of return. This is, however, hardly realistic when dealing with IRR's as high as in the search fund asset class, as there are no other asset classes you could re-apply the payouts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The comparison to a Brazilian CDB in the end must be interpreted with care since the return is in a different currency with a higher inflation and would need to be adjusted before comparing. Also, the risk profile is of course completely different (with basically zero volatility). Still, we thought it is helpful for Brazilian investors to also provide this comparison, since &quot;Safe returns from CDB&quot;is the argument we mostly heard when pitching startups to Brazilian investors. We think the argument makes sense when comparing to VC/Startup investments, however it does get less persuasive in the comparison to the opportunity to invest in a search-fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;width: 25%;&quot;&gt;Asset Class&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;width: 25%;&quot;&gt;Average IRR&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;width: 25%;&quot;&gt;Top Quartile IRR
&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;width: 25%;&quot;&gt;Average Multiple&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr class=&quot;even&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;US Private Equity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13.7%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;36.5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.4x&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;US Venture Capital&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.31x&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;US Search Fund&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;36.7%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8.4x&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;International Search Fund&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33.4%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.8x&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Brazilian CDB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;NA&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Although relatively unknown and without a doubts risky, considering the IRR it can be said that Search Funds are an asset class that can not be afforded to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We think Search Funds are especially interesting for investors who want to invest smaller tickets in a high performing asset-class. Investors who do not have the opportunity to invest as a Limited Partner in a Private Equity Fund but still would like to enjoy similar ( in fact actually much better) returns. Investors who can afford to only allocate small amounts of capital per investment but who are not satisfied with the highly volatile and lower return profile of startup-investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should be aware of the very high volatility and risk behind search funds however. We copy a part of the latest study from Stanford below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;As an asset class, search funds have achieved an ROI of 8.4x and an IRR of 36.7 percent. When excluding unsuccessful searches in order to further examine the much larger acquisition investment, the overall asset class MOIC increases to 8.5x and the effect on overall IRR is negligible. The median fund returned 1.0x of initial search fund investors’ capital, whereas the top - performing fund returned well over 200x. Excluding search funds that closed without an acquisition, the median return on all search funds that have completed an acquisition is 2.3x ROI.

The overall asset class ROI, which declined from 10.0x in 2013 to 8.3x in 2015, is partly due to recent company valuations of less than 10x, and partly due to the change in calculation methodology for the 2015 study as described at the start of this section.

Since the 2001 study, the aggregate IRR of all search funds (which included both unsuccessful searches and those that completed an acquisition) has tended to fluctuate between 32 and 38 percent, with the exception of the 2007 study, where IRR rose to 52 percent.

The performance of individual search funds has varied widely over the years. Distribution by ROI ranges from greater than 10x for highly successful companies to total loss of capital.

Distribution by IRR ranges from greater than 100 percent to negative; in cases of a total loss of capital, IRR cannot be calculated.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following picture provides a better understanding of potential outcomes and distribution of such outcomes over a sample of search-funds in the US:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/outcomes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comparison which shows how the IRR is influenced by some very high performing funds provides more information on the distribution of results, it combines findings from a Stanford study with those from an IESE study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style=&quot;width: 33%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;width: 33%;&quot;&gt;IRR - US Search Funds &lt;br /&gt; (Stanford Study)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;width: 33%;&quot;&gt;IRR - International Search Funds (IESE Study)&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr class=&quot;even&quot;&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;All Search Funds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;36.70%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;33.40%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Excluding Top-3 Funds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;28.80%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;28.80%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Excluding Top-5 Funds&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;26.70%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;17.40%&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the average performance of US as well as international Search Funds are strongly influenced by the top-performing funds, we find it interesting that the average IRR still remains considerably higher than any other asset class we compared the search fund model to.&lt;/p&gt;
