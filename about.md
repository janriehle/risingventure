<h2>The Principal</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jan3.jpg" title="Profile Picture" class="profile">

Jan Riehle is an entrepreneur who lives and works in Brazil since early 2011.

Before moving to Brazil, Jan lived and worked in Germany, Switzerland, France and Singapore.  He speaks fluent Portuguese, French, English and German. He holds an MBA from INSEAD (Dec. 09), and graduated once with a Master of Science in Economics and once with a Master of Science in Business Administration from the University of Hagen in Germany.

In Switzerland, he worked for the Swiss Mid-Market Private Equity Fund [Constellation](http://www.constellation.ch) and for the Swiss M&A Boutique [Kurmann & Partners](http://www.kurmannpartners.ch). In Brazil, he co-founded the e-commerce companies [eOtica](http://www.eotica.com.br), Juv, [Itaro](http://www.itaro.com.br) as well as the Digital Marketing company OndaLocal. He also invested in several startups from 2012 until 2015.

Jan can look back at two exits, selling Itaro to the local distributor Grupo Cantu in 2017 and eOtica in 2015 to the French Holding Essilor. Between 2013 until the exit and following transition phase in 2017, he acted as the CEO of Itaro, which today is the leading Brazilian e-Commerce company in the automotive-aftermarket.

<h2>History of Rising Venture</h2>

Rising Venture, before its re-launch as a Search-Fund in 2017, was used as the investment vehicle for the principal's investment and entrepreneurial activities in Brasil. Apart from the exits of Itaro and eOtica, Rising Venture is still holding various startup participations, of which three underwent promising developments and managed to thrive, one even to realize an IPO at the B3 in 2021.
