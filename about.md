<h2>The Principal</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jan3.jpg" title="Profile Picture" class="profile">

Jan Riehle is a German national who lives in Brazil since early 2011.

Before coming to Brazil, Jan lived and worked in Germany, Switzerland, France and Singapore.  He speaks fluent Portuguese, French, English and German. He holds an MBA from INSEAD (Dec. 09), and graduated twice, once with a Master of Science in Economics and once with a Master of Science in Business Administration from the University of Hagen in Germany.

Before moving to Brazil he worked for the Swiss Mid-Market Private Equity Fund [Constellation](http://www.constellation.ch) as well as for the Swiss M&A Boutique [Kurmann & Partners](http://www.kurmannpartners.ch). In Brazil, he co-founded the e-commerce companies [eOtica](http://www.eotica.com.br), Juv, [Itaro](http://www.itaro.com.br) as well as the Digital Marketing company OndaLocal. He also invested in several startups from 2012 until 2014.

Jan has a track record of two exits from the entrepreneurial endeavors plus still holds a portfolio of various startup companies. Between 2013 until the exit and following transition phase in 2017, he acted as the CEO of Itaro, the leading Brazilian e-Commerce company in the automotive-aftermarket space (mainly focused on tires) which achieved around R$ 30 Mio. in sales and employed about 50 people before the exit in late 2016.

Jan also is an Associate Partner in a Brazilian Law Firm, [Lima & Associados](http://www.limaeassociados.com.br), which he built as a service provider around his startup portfolio. The economic crisis that took hold of Brazil in around 2013 and reached its peak in 2016 made Jan come to the conclusion that now is the right moment to start a search fund in order to make use of the low asset prices in the country. A strong part of Rising Venture's thesis is also to modernize existing businesses through technology (offline-2-online), which leverages on Jan's past experience with technology companies and existing market potential in Brazil.

As a side note regarding the principal's technology know-how it should be mentioned that this website, which has been developed based the Ruby-on-Rails framework Jekyll, was developed 100% independently by the principal, who is experienced in developing in Ruby and Javascript.

<h2>History of Rising Venture</h2>

Rising Venture (RV), before being re-launched as a Search-Fund, was used as the investment vehicle for the principal's investment and entrepreneurial activities in Brasil.
