<h2>The Principal</h2>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jan3.jpg" title="Profile Picture" class="profile">

Jan Riehle is an entrepreneur who lives and works in Brazil since early 2011.

Before coming to Brazil, Jan lived and worked in Germany, Switzerland, France and Singapore.  He speaks fluent Portuguese, French, English and German. He holds an MBA from INSEAD (Dec. 09), and graduated twice, once with a Master of Science in Economics and once with a Master of Science in Business Administration from the University of Hagen in Germany.

Before moving to Brazil he worked for the Swiss Mid-Market Private Equity Fund [Constellation](http://www.constellation.ch) as well as for the Swiss M&A Boutique [Kurmann & Partners](http://www.kurmannpartners.ch). In Brazil, he co-founded the e-commerce companies [eOtica](http://www.eotica.com.br), Juv, [Itaro](http://www.itaro.com.br) as well as the Digital Marketing company OndaLocal. He also invested in several startups from 2012 until 2015.

Jan has a track record of two exits, selling Itaro in 2017 to the local distributor Grupo Cantu and eOtica in 2015 to the French Holding Essilor.  He also still holds a portfolio of startup companies in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Between 2013 until the exit and following transition phase in 2017, he acted as the CEO of Itaro, the leading Brazilian e-Commerce company in the automotive-aftermarket space, which achieved around R$ 30 Mio. in sales and employs about 50 people.

Jan also is an Associate Partner in a Brazilian Law Firm, [Lima & Associados](http://www.limaeassociados.com.br), which he built as a service provider around his startup portfolio. The economic crisis that affects Brazil since 2015 made Jan conclude that the moment is right to acquire businesses instead of starting them, he therefore launched the Search Fund Rising Venture,  focusing on the acquisition of technology companies in Brazil.

As a side note regarding the principal's technology know-how it should be mentioned that this website, which has been developed based the Ruby-on-Rails framework Jekyll, was developed 100% independently by the principal, who is experienced in developing in Ruby and Javascript.

<h2>History of Rising Venture</h2>

Rising Venture (RV), before being re-launched as a Search-Fund, was used as the investment vehicle for the principal's investment and entrepreneurial activities in Brasil. Apart from the recent exits of Itaro and eOtica, Rising Venture is still holding another 6 startup investments, of which at least two underwent a very promising development and management to thrive, despite the current crisis environment. The two main investments are:

<li><a href="http://www.infracommerce.com.br" target="_blank">Infracommerce</a></li>
</ul>
